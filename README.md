# Rubrik Mosiac Integration for Datadog 

## :blue_book: Documentation

Rubrikâ€™s API first architecture enables organizations to embrace and integrate Rubrik functionality into their existing automation processes. This includes integration with services offered by modern monitoring & analytics platforms like Datadog. 

This integration allows Rubrik Mosiac customers to leverage Mosiac's APIs as well as Datadog's custom metric APIs to extract useful monitoring and reporting data out of Mosiac for presentation via Datadog dashboards.
